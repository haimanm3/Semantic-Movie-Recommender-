# Semantic Movie Recommender

A simple content-based recommendation system that uses TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec to compare movie plot summaries. The system recommends movies semantically similar to a given user input (keywords or a favorite movieâ€™s plot).

## About

This project implements a content-based movie recommender using natural language processing techniques. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec embeddings to analyze and compare movie plot summaries, enabling the recommendation of semantically similar movies based on user input.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn  
- Gensim  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

## Dataset

The system utilizes the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), which includes movie overviews, titles, genres, and other metadata.

## Features

- TF-IDF-based cosine similarity for baseline recommendations  
- Word2Vec vector embeddings for deeper semantic analysis  
- Custom function to fetch top-N recommendations  
- Clean, easy-to-follow notebook format
